# Description
This is an app that allows a person to play a game where they attack the goblin through the command line. The user has the option to use two types of potions throughout the fight 
until the goblin is defeated. The round restarts after a goblin is defeated

# Module Tasks
1. Create a game that the user can play in the commmand line with Node.js
2. The user attacks an enemy with the enemy being a goblin when the application runs
3. The user chooses between a health potion and a healing poiton after each round
4. When the goblin is killed the round restarts

# Task Achieved By
The tasks for this module were achieved by reading the module and applying what I learned in my lessons.

# Running The Application
To run the application you need to first install the software program Visual Studio Code. Look up Visual Studio Code in google and download
the version of the software that is specfic to your computer. After installing Visual Studio Code Node.js will have to be installed on your 
computer as well. After both of these are installed on your computer follow the link below to my github account for this repository

Click on the green code button and copy the http option of the code. After that open up visual studio code and type the command git
clone (the http otpion of the code goes next) in the command line to pull down my repository. After that open up the terminal in 
Visual Studio Code and type node app.js and answer the prompts that follow. If node app.js does not work initally type the command
npm install inquirer to install the inquirer package.
